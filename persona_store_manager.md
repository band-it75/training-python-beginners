* **High Shrink Risk Categories** – beauty & accessories sections require continual surveillance and training.
* **Labour Budget Constraints** – balancing payroll cost against service level expectations during seasonal peaks.

### Scenario Snapshot

On the first day of a flash mid‑season sale, Michael receives a 07:00 HQ alert that promotional signage has the wrong discount on 12 SKUs. He rapidly reprioritises the morning: messages the night shift to print new shelf‑talkers, reallocates trainees to ticketing, and personally verifies price updates in the POS. By 10:00 doors‑open, signage matches system prices, avoiding guest confusion and margin loss. Simultaneously he adjusts staff breaks in the WFM app to ensure full coverage during the expected lunchtime rush.

### Summary

Michael exemplifies the **Store Manager** persona: equal parts strategist and frontline leader. His success relies on synthesising disparate data streams, coaching a diverse team, and executing brand standards without compromising financial discipline.
