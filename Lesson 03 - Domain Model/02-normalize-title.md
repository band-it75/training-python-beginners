# Normalise Task Titles

1. Open `src/models.py` created earlier.
2. Import the helper from LessonÂ 01:
   ```python
   from .utils import normalize_title
   ```
3. Add a `__post_init__` method to clean the title whenever a `Task` is created:
   ```python
   def __post_init__(self) -> None:
       self.title = normalize_title(self.title)
   ```
4. Normalising here means every `Task` instance stores a consistent title.

## Why this step?

Cleaning the title as soon as the object is created prevents messy data from
creeping into later operations. Placing this logic in `__post_init__` keeps
the class easy to use without extra calls.
## Theory example
`__post_init__` runs immediately after the dataclass-generated `__init__`. It's the ideal place for validation or normalisation logic.
