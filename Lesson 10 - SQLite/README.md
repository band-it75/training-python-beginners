# Lesson 10 â€“ SQLite

Storing data in a file-based database lets the application persist tasks between runs. This lesson introduces **SQLite** to keep things lightweight while demonstrating real SQL operations.

## Purpose of Lesson

Add a simple database so tasks survive application restarts.

## Technologies Used

- SQLite via the built-in `sqlite3` module

## Personas Involved

- Retail Staff
- Store Manager

## Expected Outcome

Tasks are saved to a local `db.sqlite3` file and can be listed again after restarting the app.
