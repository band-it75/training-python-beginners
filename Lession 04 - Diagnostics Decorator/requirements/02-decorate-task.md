# Decorate Task Completion

**As a** Retail Staff member, **I want** to see how long marking a task done takes **so that** I know the system responded.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive
- **Given** the completion method is decorated
- **When** I mark a task done
- **Then** the program prints its runtime

### Negative
- **Given** the decorator is removed
- **When** I mark a task
- **Then** no timing information is shown
