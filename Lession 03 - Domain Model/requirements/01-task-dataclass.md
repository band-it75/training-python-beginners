# Structured Task Data

**As a** Retail Staff member, **I want** each task to store the same basic details **so that** nothing is forgotten.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **When** I inspect it
- **Then** it has a title, ID, creation time and completion flag

### Negative

- **When** I use it
- **Then** the program reports an error
