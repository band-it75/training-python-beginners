# Persona Overview

A **persona** is a detailed description of a fictional user that represents a broader group of real people. Personas help teams understand user motivations, frustrations and daily routines so that product features address actual needs.

This repository uses two sample personas to guide the development of the *What TaskMate* training project:

- **Retail Staff** – the frontline store associate who completes tasks each shift.
- **Store Manager** – the person responsible for assigning work and monitoring progress.

Each persona is documented separately in [`persona_retail_staff.md`](persona_retail_staff.md) and [`persona_store_manager.md`](persona_store_manager.md). By referencing these profiles when writing user stories and code examples, the lessons stay focused on practical workflows rather than abstract requirements.
