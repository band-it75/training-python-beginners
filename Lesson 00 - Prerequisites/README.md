# Lesson 00 – Prerequisites

Before writing any code we need a reliable toolchain. This lesson walks through
installing **Visual Studio Code**, **Python 3.11** and **Git**. You will also
set up your Git credentials and confirm that each command works via the provided
PowerShell scripts. When done you should be able to open the project in VS Code
and run `python --version` and `git --version` from a terminal.

## Purpose of Lesson

Ensure every participant has a working local development environment configured
for the rest of the course.

## Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.11
- Git

## Personas Involved

No end-user personas are involved in this setup lecture.

## Expected Outcome

All required tools are installed and verified so coding can begin immediately.

1. [Install VSCode](lecture-01-install-vscode.md)
2. [Install Python 3.11](lecture-02-install-python.md)
3. [Install Git](lecture-03-install-git.md)
4. Configure Git with [setup-git.ps1](setup-git.ps1)
5. Verify the setup using [verify-prerequisites.ps1](source/tests/verify-prerequisites.ps1)
