# Install Visual Studio Code

1. Navigate to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.
2. Download the installer for your operating system and run it with the default options.
3. Start VS Code and install these extensions:
   - **Python**
   - **PowerShell**
   - **Azure Tools** (optional but recommended)

## Install via winget

If you have [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) on Windows you can run:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

## Why this step?

Using VS Code gives us an editor with great Python support. Installing the
extensions up front means features like IntelliSense and debugging work
consistently throughout the course.
## Theory example
An integrated development environment (IDE) offers helpful features such as syntax highlighting and debugging. VS Code's extension system lets us tailor it for Python development.
