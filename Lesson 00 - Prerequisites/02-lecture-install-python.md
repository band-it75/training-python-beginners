## Why this lecture?

Python is the language used for all subsequent lessons. Installing the
exact 3.11 series ensures everyone has a consistent runtime and avoids
versionâ€‘specific surprises later on.
## Theory example
Python is an interpreted language, meaning the interpreter executes your code line by line. Version numbers denote language features and standard library updates.
