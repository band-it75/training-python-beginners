### Goals & Motivations

1. **Flawless Store Opening** – disarm alarm, run light/test checks, and have front area customer‑ready by 09:00.
2. **Stock Accuracy** – ensure “shelf equals system” by completing morning cycle counts and restocking gaps before peak footfall.
3. **Superior Service** – greet every customer within 30 seconds, provide product knowledge that drives conversion, and handle returns smoothly.
4. **Sales Contribution** – meet personal attachment‑rate and credit‑card‑signup targets; support visual‑merch updates that lift AOV (average order value).
5. **Team Cohesion** – coach new part‑timers, escalate security concerns, and keep communication flowing through shift notes.
6. **Career Progression** – build metrics to justify promotion to Assistant Manager within 18 months.

### Pain Points

* **System Lag / Downtime** – POS or inventory tablets freezing during customer rush.
* **Fragmented Task Lists** – multiple apps (email, chat, paper binder) cause missed priorities.
* **Last‑Minute Promo Changes** – overnight price updates require emergency re‑ticketing before doors open.
* **Limited Staffing** – balancing queue busting with theft monitoring when short‑handed.
* **Repetitive Manual Counts** – cycle counts still require paper tally for audit, duplicating effort.

### Scenario Snapshot

On a busy Friday morning, Sofia simultaneously verifies a BOPIS order, helps a tourist find the right size jacket using the store‑tablet “endless aisle,” and updates footwear display tickets after HQ pushes a flash 20 % promo. With only two colleagues on the floor, she uses the team chat to request backup at POS, ensuring no customer waits more than three minutes.
