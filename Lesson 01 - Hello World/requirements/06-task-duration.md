# Display Task Duration

**As a** Retail Staff member, **I want** the elapsed time to show minutes and seconds **so that** I know if I met the target.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive
- **Given** the timer runs around a task
- **When** it completes
- **Then** the program prints the duration like `Xm Ys`

### Negative
- **Given** the calculated time is zero or negative
- **When** the result is shown
- **Then** the program warns that the timing is invalid
