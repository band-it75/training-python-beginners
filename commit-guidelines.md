# Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses short, structured commit messages. Every commit message should have a one-line summary followed by an optional body explaining the change.

```
<type>: <summary>

<details>
```

- **type** – `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`.
- **summary** – imperative present tense, no more than 50 characters.
- **details** – optional paragraphs wrapped at 72 characters that describe why the change was made and any noteworthy context.

Example:

```

Provide instructions for writing concise commit messages.
