# Write Useful Tests

**As a** Retail Staff member, **I want** automated checks for helpers, the domain model and the API **so that** I can change code with confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive
- **Given** tests exist for key functions
- **When** I run them
- **Then** they report success when behaviour is correct

### Negative
- **Given** a function lacks tests
- **When** it breaks
- **Then** the issue goes unnoticed until manual use
