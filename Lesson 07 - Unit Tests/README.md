# Lesson 07 â€“ Unit Tests

Reliable software needs automated tests. Here you set up **pytest** together
with `pytest-mock` and create tests for the helper functions, the `Task` class,
the Flask API and the Azure Functions wrapper. Mocks let you exercise the
serverless entry point without calling the real cloud. Running `pytest -q`
should give you a green suite that guards future changes.
