# Basic Data Types

1. Create `types_example.py` and define several variables:
   ```python
   task_id = 1
   task_title = "Open Store"
   urgent = True
   durations = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0]
   lookup = {1: "Open Store"}
   ```
2. Print each variable and its `type()` to learn how Python stores them.
   Hint: store the variables in a list and loop over it.
