# Show Data Types

**As a** Retail Staff member, **I want** to understand how numbers, text and yes/no flags appear in tasks **so that** I can follow later examples confidently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive
- **Given** the demonstration program is available
- **When** I run it
- **Then** I see each sample value and a note about its type

### Negative
- **Given** a value is missing or invalid
- **When** I run the program
- **Then** it shows a clear error message instead of crashing
