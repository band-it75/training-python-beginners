# Plan Next Start Time

As **Store Manager**, I want to know when the next task should begin so that the team stays on schedule.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the `schedule` logic in `time_example.py`
- **When** the script adds 30 minutes to now
- **Then** it prints the recommended start timestamp
