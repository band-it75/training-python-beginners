# Lesson 01 – Hello World

We start with a tiny Python program to verify the environment and show
the format of the exercises. You will implement a helper function
`normalize_title` and a `main.py` script that prints a friendly greeting. The
code only uses the Python standard library so it should run anywhere. The goal
is to execute `python main.py` and see **What TaskMate – Hello, World!** on the
console.

After verifying the greeting, the lesson expands on Python basics needed later
in the curriculum. Small follow‑up scripts cover common data types, string
concatenation, simple arithmetic and time calculations. These examples show how
**What TaskMate** might measure how long a task took or when the next task
should start.

## Purpose of Lesson

Verify that Python runs correctly and introduce the basic exercise workflow.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11 standard library

## Personas Involved

- Retail Staff
- Store Manager

## Expected Outcome

Running `python main.py` prints the greeting so students know their setup works.
