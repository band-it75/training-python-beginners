# Lesson 01 – Hello World

We start with a tiny Python program to verify the environment and demonstrate
the format of the exercises. You will implement a helper function
`normalize_title` and a `main.py` script that prints a friendly greeting. The
code only uses the Python standard library so it should run anywhere. The goal
is to execute `python main.py` and see **What TaskMate – Hello, World!** on the
console.

## Purpose of Lesson

Verify that Python runs correctly and introduce the basic exercise workflow.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11 standard library

## Personas Involved

- Retail Staff
- Store Manager

## Expected Outcome

Running `python main.py` prints the greeting so students know their setup works.
