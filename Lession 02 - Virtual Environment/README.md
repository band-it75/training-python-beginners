# Lesson 02 – Virtual Environment

A clean virtual environment keeps project dependencies separate from the rest of
your system. Using Python's built‑in `venv` module you will create an isolated
interpreter and record packages in `requirements.txt`. This ensures everyone
uses the same versions and makes deployments predictable. When done you will
have a `.venv` directory and an empty requirements file ready for later lessons.

## Purpose of Lesson

Isolate project dependencies so everyone works with the same package versions.

## Technologies Used

- Python `venv`

## Personas Involved


## Expected Outcome

An activated virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` ready for future steps.
